Steps to make communication with the Tekscan server work:
 
1. Under the Administrator command window, register the new fsxproxy64.dll.  Go to the Dependencies/tekscan directory and execute:
regsvr32 fsxproxy64.dll
 
2. Keep the existing fsxproxy.dll registered.  Under the Administrator command window, register the existing 32bit fsxproxy.dll. Go to the location of \Windows\SysWOW64> and do the following:
\Windows\SysWOW64>regsvr32 fsxproxy.dll
 
3. Modify the Client Software.  This is already done in the code. So nothing to be done here.
The following source code segment is the CoCreateInstance part for activating the Tekscan software.  The customer should change the third parameter of CoCreateInstance from CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER to CLSCTX_ALL for the 64bit client software to work without a problem.
 
if(!g_CallBackServer)
{
    hr = CoCreateInstance (
    clsid,
    NULL,
    CLSCTX_ALL,
    IID_ICustom, 
    (void **) &g_CallBackServer);
}
